## Stock Price Prediction By LSTM

This project includes training and predicting processes with LSTM for stock data. The characteristics is as fellow:

- Concise and modular
- Support three mainstream deep learning frameworks of pytorch, keras and tensorflow
- Parameters, models and frameworks can be highly customized and modified
- Supports incremental training
- Support predicting multiple indicators at the same time
- Support predicting any number of days
- Support train visualization and log record

The simultaneous predict results for stock high and low price with pytorch show as follow:
